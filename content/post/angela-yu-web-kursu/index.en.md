# Best Web Course on Udemy

To learn how to code and become a full-fledged web developer, you need 
Complete Web Development Bootcamp, the only course that is. My Web Development course is one of the HIGHEST SCORED courses in Udemy history with over 150,000 points and a 4.8 average! 

Lasting over 65 hours, this Web Development course is undoubtedly one of the
the most comprehensive web development course. Even if you have zero programming experience,
this course will take you from beginner to master. Here's why:

+ The course is taught by the lead instructor from App Brewery, London's leading face-to-face programming bootcamp.

+ The course has been updated to be ready for 2022 and you'll learn the latest tools and technologies used in major companies like Apple, Google and Netflix.

+ This course cuts no corners, there are beautifully animated explanation videos and dozens of real-world projects for you to build.

+ The curriculum was developed over a four-year period with extensive student testing and feedback.

+ We've taught over a million students how to code, and many have gone on to change their lives as professional developers or by starting their own tech startups.

+ You'll save over $12,000 by enrolling, but you'll still have access to the same teaching materials and learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.

+ The course is constantly updated with new content, with new projects and modules identified by students - that's you!


Through engaging video tutorials we will take you step-by-step and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as a web developer.

The course includes over 65 hours of HD video tutorials and builds on your programming knowledge as you create real-world websites and web applications.


Reviews about # Best Web Development Course

"Angela is amazing, wonderful and simply marvellous on this course. I have never had a trainer like this; she gives detailed, precise explanations in every area of the course, gives you the anxiety of learning etc. She has the ability to have fun while explaining things for better understanding. I really love this course." - Ekeu MonkamUlrich

"Angela is very thorough without ever being boring. I have taken MANY online courses in my life, including my undergraduate and graduate degrees, and she is the best instructor I have ever had. This course is full of great instruction worth thousands of dollars and is paced well enough that anyone can pick up coding and work with it - Thanks!" - J Carlucci

"I like the way Angela explains things, it is easy to follow and full of logic. I can tell she put a lot of energy into creating this great course. Thank you and I recommend it to anyone interested in coding!" - Yiqing Zheng

"So far (on my third day) this course has taught me more than I have learnt in many other programming courses. This course builds on itself gradually in a clearly summarised and easy to understand way." - Normal Ramsey

"This course will really take you from beginner to intermediate level. If you don't know how to put the pieces of web development together this is what you are looking for. Angela does a great job explaining the concepts in real practice, creating projects throughout this course. Thank you so much, Angela. I will always consider you as my mentor and I can't wait to take more courses with you." - Moises Dionisio Cruz

"Great course, perfect for absolute beginners at the beginning of their coding journey! Angela is a great instructor and is able to explain even complex coding concepts in the most simple and understandable way. Learning web development doesn't get more fun than this!" - Zoe Moyssoglou

"A different approach to Web Development training. I love that you are given everything possible to succeed right from the start." - Ronick Thomas

The teacher is simply AMAZING, the best teacher I have ever had. I would give him 10 out of 5 stars. He doesn't just punch the code and talk to himself, but he actually explains things. He keeps giving really helpful tips and will give you lots of other references. I always knew what I was doing and why I was doing it. All the extra challenges made me remember and understand things better. - Peter Dlugos
