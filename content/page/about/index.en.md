Merhaba ben Mustafa! Bu bloğu internette faydalı buldğum çeşitli yazılım hakkında bilgirendirici şeyler için kullanacağım. Her gün kontrol et!

Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremelly fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
